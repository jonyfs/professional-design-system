# Professional Design System

Accessible HTML + Tailwind CSS primitive components (Button, Text Input, Badge,
Checkbox, Radio, Select, Toggle/Switch, Modal, Toast, Slide-over, Breadcrumbs,
Accordion, Tabs, Dropdown Menu, Avatar, Card, Alert/Banner), built exclusively
on the semantic design tokens ratified in
[`.specify/memory/constitution.md`](.specify/memory/constitution.md).
Modal/Slide-over/Dropdown Menu use native `<dialog>`/Popover API for
focus-trapped or light-dismissable overlays; Accordion uses native
`<details>`/`<summary>`. Toast, Modal/Slide-over's dismiss wiring, Tabs,
and Dropdown Menu's keyboard/focus wiring are this project's only
JavaScript (`src/scripts/`), everything else is pure HTML + Tailwind. A
minimal project-wide Content-Security-Policy is set via `<meta>` tag on
every page.

The first 10 components (Button through Slide-over) are also published as
a React + TypeScript package at [`packages/react/`](packages/react/) —
see [React package](#react-package) below. **Both are maintained in
parallel**: the static HTML gallery remains the ratified reference
implementation, and the React package is a port that must stay visually
and behaviorally identical to it, verified by pixel-parity Playwright
tests seeded from the static gallery's own approved baselines. Breadcrumbs,
Accordion, Tabs, Dropdown Menu (feature 005), Avatar, Card, and Alert/Banner
(feature 006) are static-only for now — a React port is a separate future
feature.

## Requirements

- Node.js 18+

## Setup

```bash
npm install
npx playwright install --with-deps   # one-time browser download for tests
```

## Scripts

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `npm run dev` | Start the Vite dev server and open the component gallery |
| `npm run build` | Production build (gallery + all component pages) to `dist/` |
| `npm run preview` | Preview the production build locally |
| `npm run test:e2e` | Run the full Playwright suite (visual regression + accessibility) |
| `npm run audit:tokens` | Fail if any shipped markup uses a non-ratified Tailwind color/radius class (Principle IV) |
| `npm run audit:contrast` | Fail if any documented text/background pairing is below WCAG 2.2 AAA (Principle II) |
| `npm run typecheck` | Type-check the project's `.ts` config/test files |

## Visual regression baselines (cross-platform)

CI runs on `ubuntu-latest`. Playwright names snapshot files by OS
(`*-linux.png`, `*-darwin.png`, ...), so a baseline generated on macOS never
satisfies a Linux CI run, and vice versa — **always regenerate baselines
inside the official Playwright Docker image**, matching CI, not with a bare
`npx playwright test --update-snapshots` on your host OS:

```bash
docker run --rm -v "$(pwd)":/work -w /work \
  mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.61.1-noble \
  bash -c "npm ci && npx playwright test --update-snapshots"
```

(Bump the image tag to match this repo's installed `@playwright/test`
version.) Commit both the `-darwin.png` and `-linux.png` sets that result —
local `npm run test:e2e` on a Mac still needs the `-darwin.png` files, CI
needs the `-linux.png` files. After running the container, reinstall
`node_modules` for your host OS (`rm -rf node_modules && npm install`) —
the bind mount leaves Linux-native binaries behind otherwise.

## Component gallery

Run `npm run dev` and open the printed local URL. The gallery links out to
each component's own standalone page (`src/components/<name>/<name>.html`) —
every component page is independently valid and copy-pasteable, per each
feature's "Independent Test" requirement.

## React package

[`packages/react/`](packages/react/) publishes 10 of the components above
(Button, Text Input, Badge, Checkbox, Radio, Select, Toggle, Modal, Toast,
Slide-over) as `@professional-design-system/react`, a React + TypeScript
package built
with `tsup` (ESM + CJS + `.d.ts`) and Tailwind CSS compiled to a
self-contained `dist/styles.css`. It exists so the design system can be
consumed by React tooling — including
[Claude Design](https://claude.ai/design), which ingests a compiled
`dist/`, extractable prop types, and self-contained CSS.

```bash
npm install @professional-design-system/react
```

```tsx
import { Button, Modal } from "@professional-design-system/react";
import "@professional-design-system/react/styles.css";

function Example() {
  return <Button variant="primary">Save</Button>;
}
```

Every component's props are typed and exported (`ButtonProps`,
`ModalProps`, etc.) — see `packages/react/src/index.ts` for the full
barrel export, or each component's own `.tsx` file for its prop
JSDoc. `Modal`/`SlideOver` accept a `triggerRef` prop (recommended when
the trigger is a `<Button>`) so focus reliably returns to the trigger on
close across browsers, including WebKit, which does not focus a
`<button>` on mouse click the way Chromium/Firefox do.

Build from source:

```bash
npm run build --workspace packages/react
npm run typecheck --workspace packages/react
```

`tests/react-harness/` is a dev-only Vite app (not published) used
exclusively to exercise the React components under Playwright; it has
no bearing on the published package's runtime behavior.

## Governance

Every component must comply with the project constitution's Core Principles
(accessibility, token discipline, interactive state completeness, Tailwind-only
styling). See each feature's `specs/*/contracts/*.md` for the exact markup
contract each component implements.
